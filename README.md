# JustWipe

## Feature Set

* Supports overwriting an entire drive with 0s (actually removing data, not just hiding it.)
* Can overwrite a drive or partition if specified.

## How to install

To get the source code of this software you'll need the `git` version control software.
You probably already have it installed, you can check `git --version`.
If you get an error message then you must install `git` from your distro's repositories.

For the installation of this software a C compiler is required. Your distro already has one installed, it's probably `gcc`.
If not, then you need to install `gcc` You can check with `gcc --version`. If you get an error message then you must install
`gcc` from your distro's repositories.

You'll also need `make`, you likely already have this installed. You can check with `make --version`.
If you get an error message then you must install `make` from your distro's repositories.

This program is built with `glibc` in mind. If you use a different C library it may not function as expected.
This does not mean it doesn't work with other C libraries, this means i haven't confirmed functionality with
all the C libraries out there. Ensure you're using `glibc` before complaining about broken software.

Now that we have all the dependencies present we can compile the project. The following instructions assume the bash shell, though these instructions will work with the *vast* majority of linux shells (everything you're likely to use).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/El-Wumbus/JustWipe.git
cd JustWipe
sudo make install
```

## Usage

```bash
# To wipe a partition. replace sdXY with the partition you want to wipe.
# Ensure you aren't trying to wipe a mounted drive
sudo jwipe /dev/sdXY -v

# To wipe an entire drive
sudo jwipe /dev/sdX -v
```
